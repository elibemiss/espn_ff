database created from ESPNs unofficial API for fantasy football stats/projections/analytics
### I've spent some time looking into different ESPN APIs to find historical fantasy football statistics and projections. So far I've just set up some requests and functions that extract the data into more accessible content. 

### These include:
  #### player-level historical data -- positional ranks, season statistics, etc.
  #### individual season performances including team data ( W/L, home/away, scores, dates, other time series data)
  #### passing/rushing/receiving leaders in table form per season request
  #### 2024 fantasy projections
